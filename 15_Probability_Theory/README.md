### Definition of probability

-   Probability is a numerical description of how likely an event is to occur or how likely it is that a proposition is true.
-   Probability is a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking, 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty.
-   The sum of all probabilities in a set must sum to 1.
-   We need probability when there is uncertainty about the outcome of an event.

### Data types for probability

-   Discrete
-   Ordinal
-   Nominal
-   Interval or Ratio -> convert them to discrete

### Data validity for probability

-   Data must have mutually exclusive labels or bins.
-   Because total probabilities must sum to 1 (100%).

The **probability** of event **_i_** is the **count of events** **_i_** divided by the **total number of all events.**
