### Stats Lingo

-   **Dependent Variable (outcome variable):** The variable you are trying to explain.
-   **Independent Variable (explanatory variable):** The variables that you hope will explain the dependent variable.
-   **Model:** A model is an equation that explains some features in a dataset.
-   Residuals should be small, but model should be simple.
-   Residuals should be small, but models should be relevant.
-   A model should be as simple as it can be, and as complicated as it must be.

### Hypothesis

-   A falsifiable claim that requires verification, typically from experimental or observational data, and that allows for predictions about future observations.
-   Hypotheses improve experiment design, critical thinking and data analyses.
-   Hypotheses transform loose ideas into concrete and specific claims.
-   Hypotheses are used to develop new and more accurate theories, and to dissolve bad theories.
-   Most progress in science, engineering and medicine is the result of hypothesis-testing.
-   The **null hypothesis** is the hypothesis that nothing interesting is happening in the data.
-   It is not possible to prove an hypothesis.
-   Hypotheses can be rejected or fail to be rejected (interpreted as being supported).
