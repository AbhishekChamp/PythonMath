### Confidence Interval

**Definition:** The probability that an unknown population parameter falls within a range of values in repeated samples

### Factors that influence confidence intervals

-   Confidence intervals are influenced by the **sample size** and **variance.**
-   When sample size is larger, confidence intervals are close together.
-   When the variance is smaller, confidence intervals are closer together.

### Bootstrapping

##### Advantages

-   Works for any kind of parameter (mean, variance, correlation, median)
-   Useful for limited data (e.g., no experiment repetitions)
-   Not based on assumptions of normality

##### Limitations

-   Gives (slightly) different results each time
-   Can be time-consuming for large datasets
-   Sample must be a good representation of the population
