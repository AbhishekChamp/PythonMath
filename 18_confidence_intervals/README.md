### Confidence Interval

**Definition:** The probability that an unknown population parameter falls within a range of values in repeated samples

### Factors that influence confidence intervals

-   Confidence intervals are influenced by the **sample size** and **variance.**
-   When sample size is larger, confidence intervals are close together.
-   When the variance is smaller, confidence intervals are closer together.
