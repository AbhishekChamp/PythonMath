### One-sample t-test: assumptions

-   Data are numeric **_(not categorical)_**, ideally interval or ratio **_(discrete is probably OK)_**
-   Data are independent from each other.
-   Data are randomly drawn from the population to which generalization should be made.
-   Mean and standard deviation are valid descriptors of central tendency and dispersion **_(i.e., data are approximately normally distributed)._**
