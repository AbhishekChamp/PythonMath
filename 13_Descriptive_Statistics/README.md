### Descriptive Statistics

-   Describing the characteristics of a dataset:
    -   Mean, median, mode
    -   Variance
    -   Kurtosis, skew
    -   Distribution shape
    -   Spectrum
-   **_Notes:_** No realtion to population; no generalization to other datasets or groups.

### Inferential Statistics

-   Using features of the dataset to make laims about a population.
    -   P-value
    -   T / F / chi-square value
    -   Confidence intervals
    -   Hypothesis testing
-   **_Notes:_** The entire purpose is to relate data features to populations or generalize to other groups!

### A, P, R : Definitions

**Accuracy:** The relationship between the measurement and actual truth **_(inversely related to bias)._**

**Precision:** The certainty of each measurement **_(inversely related to variance)._**

**Resolution:** The number of data points per unit measurement **_(time, space, individual, ...)._**

### Data Distributions - Why we need them

-   Most statistical procedures are based on assumptions about distributions.
-   Knowing these distributions is necessary for appropriately applying statistics.
-   Data distributions provide insights into nature.
-   Physical and biological systems are modeled using distributions.
